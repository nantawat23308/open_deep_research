## Gold Saints

The Gold Saints are the most powerful of Athena's Saints, each possessing mastery over the seventh sense and wielding Gold Cloths.

*Cosmos and Gold Saints*

Cosmos is the ability to manipulate the energy of the universe in patterns specific to each individual's training [1]. Gold Saints demonstrate exceptional talent, developing advanced cosmos manipulation techniques from an early age [1].

*Gold Saint Power Dynamics*

Most Gold Saints are evenly matched, with the outcome of battles determined by compatibility [1].

### Aries Mu

Aries Mu is one of the strongest Gold Saints, although his martial prowess and speed are not his best attributes [1]. He excels in telekinetic powers, granting him effective control over his cosmos [1]. His deep technical understanding of cosmos comes from repairing cloths [1]. He can create energy resembling matter, like his Crystal Wall, or vibrate it to mimic starlight [1]. His attacks and defenses can be overcome by more directly offensive attacks [1].

*   **Crystal Wall:** Mu can easily block the combined power of Deathmask and Aphrodite with his Crystal Wall [3]. His Crystal Wall also blocked attacks from Iapeto in Episode G [3].
*   **Starlight Extinction:** Mu manipulates light via Starlight Extinction [6].
*   Mu controls the cemetery of cloths, manipulating sounds, using telekinesis, and creating illusions [6].
*   Mu has teleportation abilities, teleporting Shiryu's coffin around a distance of 5,000km [6].
*   In Episode G, Iapeto created a Universe, and Aries Mu absorbs it [3].
*   In Episode G, Aries Mu has his power compared to the Infinitely expanding Universe [3].
*   Mu is wise, thoughtful, and always collected [6]. He repairs the Bronze Saints' Cloths and teaches them about the 7th Sense [6].
*   Mu's cosmo is fearsome for saints like Cancer Deathmask [3].
*   Libra Dohko claims that Mu has never demonstrated his true power [3].
*   Shion was able to destroy the Crystal wall (Which blocked attacks from Iapeto in G) with a hand wave [3].
*   In *Saint Seiya*, Aries Mu informs the remaining Gold Saints about Gemini Saga's treason alongside Libra Dohko [6].
*   In *Saint Seiya: Episode G - Assassin*, Aries Kiki is a Gold Saint of Sanctuary [4].
*   Aries Mu is a descendant of the Mythical People of Lemuria [6]. He was naturally born with a great talent for Cosmic Control and all manner of Psychokinesis [6].
*   During the series, Aries Mu is one of the greatest allies of the Bronze Saints [6].

### Taurus Aldebaran

Aldebaran is the strongest in terms of raw physical power and among the fastest Gold Saints [1]. His attacks work on the principle of repelling, generating force in the opposite direction [1]. His technique is gravity and earth-based [1]. His technique is like a bull charging, with his weakness being the need to charge by folding his arms before attacking, leaving him open after attacking with his Great Horn [1]. He tends to take more damage and struggle against opponents with a more indirect technique [1]. While fast, he isn't agile, and his attacks tend to focus in one direction [1].

*   In the Classic Manga, Taurus Aldebaran "lolnopes" a "Big Bang" from Seiya [3].
*   Taurus Aldebaran is killed in the attack by the specter, Papillon Myu [4].
*   Tarurs Aldy should scale to the big bang of Seiya's 7th sense [3].
*   Aldebaran is an easy-going person who likes to buy little mementos [12]. He has strong faith in his beliefs and learns from his past errors, seeing them as steps and not sins [12].
*   Aldebaran's guardian constellation is Taurus, and his Gold Cloth represents the Cretan Bull, captured by Heracles as his seventh task [14].
*   Aldebaran could have killed all of them if he used his true power, but Aldebaran answered that if his enemies were fighting so hard, then their beliefs couldn't be all wrong [12].
*   In the beginning of the Poseidon chapter, Aldebaran followed Athena to the hospital where Seiya, Hyoga, Shiryu and Shun was [14].
*   The Great Horn is the most used attack by Aldebaran, it is a direct and strong blow at great speed capable of destroying even the strongest [15].
*   In Saint Seiya Omega, Taurus Harbinger is a Gold Saint [4].
*   As revealed by Masami Kurumada in [vol.12](http://vol.12) of his manga, Aldebaran became a Gold Saint at an early age. He had already been granted the Gold Saint status and the Taurus Gold Cloth by the time he was 7 years old [14].
*   In *Saint Seiya: Episode G - Assassin*, Taurus Aldebaran is a Gold Saint of Sanctuary [4].
*   Aldebaran knew that the Bronze Saints truly believed that Athena is on their side and had his own misgivings about the Pope's claims that they were traitors [14].

### Gemini Saga/Kanon

Saga's offensive power's sheer destructive capability is unmatched by any of the Gold Saints [1]. His techniques are based on manipulating the fundamental forces of the universe, allowing him to warp reality to do things like creating and destroying a miniature galaxy (Galaxian Explosion), opening dimensional holes (Another Dimension), and even small-scale attacks like controlling the flow of the brain (Demon Emperor Fist) [1]. He complements this with powerful blows [1]. He is among the faster and physically strongest Gold Saints and among the most versatile [1]. His Galaxian Explosion is lava-based, turning planets into balls of magma and plasma [1].

*   After the Wailing Wall, Grand Pope Kanon & Sagittarius Aiolos take the Pope position [4].
*   In *Saint Seiya*, Gemini Saga stages a coup to take Sanctuary, killing the Grand Pope and Sagittarius Aiolos [4].
*   After the death of Saga, Gemini Kanon dons the Gemini Gold Cloth [4]. He and Libra Dohko proceed to fight Hades's army in the Underworld [4].
*   In *Saint Seiya: Episode G - Assassin*, Gemini Saga is a Gold Saint of Sanctuary [4].
*   Kanon was once a powerful and respected member of the Sanctuary, but after failing to become the Pope, his resentment and jealousy towards his brother Saga became too much to handle [16]. His hatred turned him to the dark powers of Hades, where he became one of the most dangerous enemies the Saints ever faced [16]. Despite his evil nature, Kanon has some noble qualities [16].
*   The very first introduction of the ability "Photon Burst" Saga compares it to him. It is the power to "Destroy Galaxies." [3].
*   This series also introduces the concept of a thirteenth Gold Saint, representing the Ophiuchus constellation, who is said to be an evil Saint. The Ophiuchus House is buried and hidden beneath the temple of Sagittarius [4].

### Cancer Deathmask

Deathmask's techniques are based more around the submission of the opponent with attacks that target the soul directly than blows [1]. His technique is based on necromancy, which he uses to send signals onto his opponent's soul to damage it [1]. The main cause of his underperformance as Gold Saint is because he has allowed his status to go to his head, possibly as a coping mechanism over having been part in the murder of Aioros which has lead him to become more and more unstable and homicidal which in turn has lead him to forego his training, to go for easier battles in order to satisfy his blood lust and over rely on his gold cloth as a defense [1]. He is less adaptable, so when he encounters an opponent that can resist him he doesn't find ways around him [1].

*   Aries Mu: with his Crystal wall was able to casually block the combined power of Deathmask, and Aphordite [3].
*   Deathmask does have a statement of being the weakest gold saint though [3].
*   Cancer Deathmask is killed during the battle of the Twelve Houses [4].
*   Aiolia is comparable to a galaxian explosion by Saga. Scorpio Milo had to actively defend aganist it to not be killed, or severly injured [3].
*   In *Saint Seiya: Episode G - Assassin*, Cancer Deathmask is a Gold Saint of Sanctuary [4].
*   Cancer Deathmask is a character from the Saint Seiya Franchise, first introduced during the Classic Saint Seiya Manga/Anime [6].
*   His technique is based on necromancy which he uses to send signals on to his opponent's soul to damage it [1].

### Leo Aiolia

Aiolia's fighting style is reliant almost entirely on his incredibly deadly punches [1]. While Aldebaran might surpass him as far as raw speed goes, Aiolia has better reaction time and unlike his friend's unidirectional attacks, his are a lot more wide spread, as he is a lot more agile [1]. His fighting style is pretty similar to Seiya's [1]. Aiolia's fighting style is like the sharp claws of a lion in the form of boxing [1]. His attacks are all about accelerating his cosmos to form Lightning [1].

*   Leo Aiolia is comparable to a closed eye Shaka Dohko and Shion scale together as well. Shion in his prime had the power to recreate, and destroy "The Universe" [3].
*   Seiya scales to Aiolia as well with the 7th sense [3].
*   Episode G Aiolia should have a Multi-Galaxy key [3].
*   His technique is centered around the use of bow and arrow and not only in the obvious sense [1].
*   In *Saint Seiya: Episode G - Assassin*, Leo Ikki is a Gold Saint of the Lost World's Sanctuary [4].
*   In the *Saint Seiya: Next Dimension* characters, Leo Ikki is a Gold Saint of the 21st century [4].

### Virgo Shaka

Shaka has by far the best defense of all the Gold Saints, capable of withstanding the Galaxian Explosion and to a debatable degree the Athena Exclamation [1]. His techniques are based around creating void [1]. His days of meditation and his wisdom from past lives has granted him great understanding of the nature of cosmos [1]. By meditating he can remove distractions to increase his attacks [1]. His favorite techniques allow him to share his knowledge of the truth of the universe [1]. His greatest technique, the Tenbu Horin, is a combination of all of the above mentioned powers, creating a pocket dimension of pure void, and allowing him to overwhelm the minds of opponents with this void, taking away their senses [1].
